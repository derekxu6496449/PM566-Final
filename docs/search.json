So the dataset should be collected no later than 2009, which is a relatively old dataset. This dataset was collected in terms of questionnaires where paticipants were given certain questions with preset types of responses.\n\nI will use this dataset to investigate the following two questions:  \n\nWhat are the main factors that influence whether a person smokes or not?  \nFor those who smoke, what are the main factors that influence the number of cigarettes smoke per day?\n\n\nOnly interactive figures or tables will be shown on the home page. To get the actual report, please click “Download the report” on the top right corner."
