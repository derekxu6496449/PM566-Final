HI, here is the homepage of my final project: https://derekxu6496449.github.io/PM566-Final/

Smoking, a global public health concern, has been the subject of extensive research due to its significant impact on human health and well-being. The detrimental effects of smoking on health are well-documented, with strong associations found between smoking and numerous health conditions including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, and various types of cancer. Additionally, smoking has also been linked to lifestyle factors and socio-economic status, further complicating its impact on public health.

This project used a dataset obtained from the internet to answer two main questions:
1. What are the main factors that influence whether a person smokes or not?
2. For those who smoke, what are the main factors that influence the number of cigarettes smoke per day?
